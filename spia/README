SPIA is a Python module for calculating Single Premium Immediate
Annuity and Deferred Income Annuity prices. This involves combining
life tables with interest rate yield curves. The lifetables are hard
coded, while the interest rate data is obtained from the U.S. Treasury
using the fetch_yield_curve script.

The package comprises the following files:

    __init__.py - exported package definitions
    income_annuity.py - SPIAs and DIAs
    life_table.py - mortality table
    yield_curve.py - interest rate yield curve
    monotone_convex.py - yield curve interpolation
    fetch_yield_curve.py - yield curve data file retrieval
    test.py
    test.out
    test
    README
    LICENSE
    agpl-3.0.txt

They should normally all be stored in the directory spia .

The package depends on scipy for yield curve interpolation and the
catdoc xls2csv program for the corporate interest rate.

On Ubuntu, to obtain these modules:

    sudo apt install python3-scipy catdoc

When the module is first used it will automatically download yield
curve data for all time from the Treasury and store it in the
directory ~/.spia .  This may take a few minutes. Subsequent
invocations will only download yield curve data if a request is made
for a yield curve with a date not found in ~/.spia .

Alternatively the yield curve data can be downloaded manually:

    chmod +x fetch_yield_curve.py
    ./fetch_yield_curve.py -t nominal
    ./fetch_yield_curve.py -t real
    ./fetch_yield_curve.py -t corporate

Subsequent runs of fetch_yield_curve.py will only download updates to
the yield curve data.

The module can be used to compute the payouts and premiums for various
annuities:

    chmod +x test
    ./test

This should print "OK", or show the differences between the expected
results and the obtained results.

See test.py for some examples of the various options, or the
documentation in the source code.
