SPIA is a Python module for calculating Single Premium Immediate
Annuity and Deferred Income Annuity prices. This involves combining
life tables with interest rate yield curves. The lifetables are hard
coded, while the interest rate data is obtained from the U.S. Treasury
using the fetch_yield_curve script.

The package comprises the following files:

    __init__.py - exported package definitions
    income_annuity.py - SPIAs and DIAs
    life_table.py - mortality table
    yield_curve.py - interest rate yield curve
    monotone_convex.py - yield curve interpolation
    fetch_yield_curve.py - yield curve data file retrieval
    test.py
    test
    README
    LICENSE
    agpl-3.0.txt

They should normally all be stored in the directory spia .

The package depends on scipy for yield curve interpolation and the
catdoc xls2csv program to obtain the corporate interest rate.

On Ubuntu, to obtain these modules:

    sudo apt-get install python3-scipy catdoc

Then to fetch the yield curves for all time and store the results in
the directory ~/.spia (this could take a while):

    chmod +x fetch_yield_curve.py
    ./fetch_yield_curve.py -t nominal
    ./fetch_yield_curve.py -t real
    ./fetch_yield_curve.py -t corporate

Subsequent runs of fetch_yield_curve.py will only download updates to the
data.

The module can then be run to compute, as an example, the payout
associated with a given premium and money's worth ratio:

    chmod +x test
    ./test

Full details of all the options available are contained in the source
code.
