Each episode starts with the same scenario. How the episode evolves
will depend on market returns and your investment decisions.
</p>

<h2>The scenario</h2>

<p>
It is the year 2020. The client is a 65 year old female. They are, and
will remain, in good health, with a life expectancy 3 years long than
the average for a 65 year old female. They start with $500,000 of tax
free investment assets, and Social Security providing $16,000 per year
of inflation indexed guaranteed income,
</p>

<p>

Annual well-being varies depending upon the annual consumption amount.
Technically, well-being is described as exhibiting constant relative
risk aversion with a coefficient of relative risk aversion of 3, as
shown in the graph to the right.
</p>

<p>
The client has an unlimited psychological ability to stomach changes
in investment portfolio value. They have no bequest motive. They
simply seek to maximize their overall well-being while they are alive.
</p>

<h2>Your task</h2>

<p>
You have to decide how much the client should consume each period, and
how they should invest the remainder. The available asset classes are:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Stocks - stocks are expected to return 1.5% below their
historical value and have a geometric mean return after inflation of
3.6% with an annual volatility of 17.4%. </li>
<li> Government bonds - you pick the duration; bond returns will be
similar to average historical values; 5 year duration bonds have an
average 1.3% return after inflation and a 5.7% volatility. </li>
<li> Inflation-indexed government bonds (TIPS) - you pick the
duration; TIPS will have similar to average post-2004 historical
values; 5 year duration TIPS have an average 1.0% return and 3.8%
volatility; the spread between government bonds and TIPS will match
inflation expectations. </li>
</ul>

<p>
So you have full information on the investment scenario you will be
presented with the current yield curve. It isn't critical to use it,
but small gains may be possible through market timing. Both short-term
interest rates and inflation exhibit larger standard deviations than
is normal. This is an unwelcome side effect of the simple bond pricing
model used, and can be ignored. Values for longer durations are more
realistic.
</p>

<p>
Inflation will largely match historical values. Occasionally the
inflation rate may may become negative. This too is an unwanted side
effect of the bond pricing model that can be ignored. It should not be
a cause for alarm.
</p>

<p>
Single Premium Immediate Annuities (SPIAs) may be purchased at any age
in any amount, and there is no transactional overhead from doing so.
Non-inflation indexed SPIAs have a money's worth ratio of 100% after
fees when measured against government bonds. Inflation indexed SPIAs
have a money's worth ratio of 94% when measured against TIPS.
</p>

<p>
The client will likely die at some point during the episode, however
each episode lasts until age 120. I wish to understand the strategy
you would use if the client were still alive. Once the client's wealth
has been spent down you can indicate that the client should consume
the full amount of their income for each remaining time step to avoid
having to step all the way through until age 120.
</p>

<p>
This is a simplified world. There are no taxes or transaction costs to
consider. There is no need for an emergency fund.
</p>

<p>
You should use your professional judgment, and if you wish a
calculator, but no other software. You may take as long as you wish to
make your decisions. You should complete a whole number of episodes,
rather than stopping midway through an episode.
