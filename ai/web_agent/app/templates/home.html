<h2>Financial planning assessment</h2>

<p>
Thank you for being willing to assist me.
</p>

<p>
I am developing software to assist in financial planning. In order to
know how well, or how poorly, this software performs I need to
benchmark it aginst the performance of real financial planners at the
same task. I would thus appreciate it if you can take an hour of your
time to make some spending and investment decisions for me.
