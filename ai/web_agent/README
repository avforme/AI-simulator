The code here provides a web server for interacting with the FinEnv
model. It is intended to be used for benchmarking AIPlanner against
financial advisors.

To use it, first generate app/static/utility.png:

    cd app
    ./plot.gnuplot

Run the webserver:

    sudo /usr/bin/python3 manage.py runserver --nothreading dev.aiplanner.com:80

--nothreading is important. All users share the same FinEnv object,
and the code in app/views.py is not thread safe.

Have financial advisors interact with the webserver:

    <visit> http://dev.aipalnner.com/start

Results will be logged to app/static/user<n> .

Cleanup:

    sudo rm -r app/static/utilitypng app/static/user*
