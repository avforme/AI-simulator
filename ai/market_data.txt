master_stocks_price = 1.3 # Rough estimate of current stock market price to long term fair price.
    # The U.S. market is presently widely considered to be somewhat overvalued. To get a handle on this we examined P/E ratios.
    # For 1950-2017 the harmonic mean S&P 500 P/E ratio (not CAPE) was 14.85 (based on Shiller's data).
    # This compares to a TTM P/E of 25.47 at the end of 2017, and a 12 month forward P/E of 16.0 (FactSet May 4, 2018).
    # Thus two reasonable estimates are the market is 10% and 70% overvalued.
