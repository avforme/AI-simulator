market_data_url: https://www.aiplanner.com/apiserver/market-data.json
    # Address to use to periodically pull market data:
    #     real and nominal interest rates
    #     stock price to fair value estimate
    #     stock volatility
    # Set to the value disable to prevent pulling of market data. You
    # should then supply estimates of these parameters when performing
    # /api/infer or /api/evaluate, otherwise possibly incorrect default
    # values will be used.

host: 0.0.0.0
    # Address on which to run the api server.
    # The api server is run in production inside a docker container,
    # and so needs to listen on the docker internal public interface
    # 0.0.0.0. This should be mapped to localhost via:
    #     docker run -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 ...
    # For development host should be localhost, or the port should be
    # firewalled.
port: 3000
    # Port on which to run the api server.
    
num_infer_jobs: null
    # Number of parallel inference (/api/infer) jobs to run.
    # Each job may have multiple scenarios and multiple RRA values.
    # A value of null scales based on the number of physical cores present.
    # Set to 0 to disable inference.

num_evaluate_jobs: null
    # Number of parallel evaluate (/api/evaluate) jobs to run.
    # Each job has a single scenario and may have multiple RRA values.
    # A value of null scales based on the number of physical cores present.
    # Set to 0 to disable evaluation.

admin_email: null
    # Email address to receive system notification messages.
    # These are usually generated when there is a problem processing a
    # request. A value of null sends any system notification messages
    # to the docker log.

notify_email: notify@aiplanner.com
notify_name: 'AIPlanner Notify'
    # Email address and username that any system notification messages
    # appear to be coming from.

project_name: AIPlanner
    # Used in the subject line of system notification messages.
