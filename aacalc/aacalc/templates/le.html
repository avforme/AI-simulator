<h1>Percentile life expectancy calculator</h1>

<p>
The life expectancies most commonly quoted in official U.S. tables and
reports are wrong for retirement planning on 4 counts:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Mean vs. percentile - for retirement planning purposes you have
to plan assuming you might live significantly longer than the mean
reported value, such as the 95th percentile life expectancy, for which
there is a 95% chance that you won't exceed
<li> Individual vs. couple - for many, what matters is the life
expectancy of the last survivor
<li> Period vs. cohort tables - i.e. failure to take into account
mortality improvement trends
<li> Average health is assumed - yet the life expectancies of those of
below average health and above average health are quite different
</ul>

<p>
Compute your life expectancy:

Additional years of life expectancy if you are of average health (includes people with
chronic illnesses and terminal conditions):
</p>

<p>
Additional years of life expectancy if you are healthy (based on holders of
annuities; inaccurate if you are young):
