<h1>Variable Withdrawal Showdown</h1>

<p>
We compare 5 asset allocation strategies x 6 withdrawal strategies against the optimal results computed using Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) for various retirement portfolios.
</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>
SDP is a general purpose mathematical technique that can be applied to asset allocation to compute the optimal asset allocation as a function of the current age and current portfolio size. Correlations between asset classes are allowed but the one requirement of SDP is that asset class returns come from a known distribution that is independent over time.
</p>

<p>
SDP asset allocation can be extended to compute the optimal time varying withdrawal amount by treating the withdrawal amount analogous to an asset class, and for each location trying each different withdrawal possibility, evaluating it, and picking the best one.
</p>

<h2>Strategies</h2>

<p>
We consider the following asset allocation strategies:
</p>

<table>
<tr> <td> fixed                 </td> <td> a fixed percentage of stocks/bonds </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> age in bonds          </td> <td> age divided by 100 in bonds </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> age minus 10 in bonds </td> <td> age minus 10 divided by 100 in bonds </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> target date           </td> <td> the consensus target date fund as tracked by the S&P Target Date indexes and reported by iShares as of June 30, 2012 but with all equities treated as U.S. stocks, and all fixed income treated as 10 year Treasuries </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> SDP                   </td> <td> SDP with goal maximize lifetime CE </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
We consider the following withdrawal strategies:
</p>

<table>
<tr> <td> amount     </td> <td> a fixed amount each year; described here in terms of the initial investment portfolio withdrawal rate </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> percentage </td> <td> a fixed percentage of the current portfolio size </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> 1/life     </td> <td> portfolio size / remaining life expectancy; this is the formula the IRS uses to compute Required Minimum Distributions, although in the scenarios considered here life expectancy is for the longest surviving member of a couple </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> hybrid     </td> <td> the larger of amount or 1/life </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> SDP        </td> <td> SDP with goal maximize lifetime CE </td> </tr>
</table>

<h2>Scenarios</h2>

<p>
In <a href="http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/39169/1/MPRA_paper_39169.pdf">Choosing a retirement income strategy: a new evaluation framework</a> Pfau suggests evaluating asset allocation using three scenarios from different cells of the RIAA client segmentation matrix:
</p>

<table>
<tr> <td>                             </td> <td> portfolio size </td> <td> desired spending </td> <td> minimal needs </td> <td> Social Security </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> mass market - underfunded   </td> <td>       $100,000 </td> <td>        [$35,000] </td> <td>     [$30,000] </td> <td>         $20,000 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> affluent - constrained      </td> <td>       $500,000 </td> <td>        [$50,000] </td> <td>     [$35,000] </td> <td>         $20,000 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> high net worth - overfunded </td> <td>     $1,000,000 </td> <td>        [$65,000] </td> <td>     [$50,000] </td> <td>         $35,000 </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
We make use of these example scenarios as expanded on more fully at the end of this note. Bracketed values were not used in the analysis here.
</p>

<h2>Evaluation metric</h2>

<p>
When evaluating how well a particular strategy performs we use the concept of a lifetime Certainty Equivalent (CE) amount. The lifetime CE is the constant consumption amount to be experienced until death which has the same expected utility as the consumption sequence actually experienced. Unfortunately we are unable to use the Withdrawal Efficiency Ratio (WER) promulgated by Blanchett et al. in <a href="http://corporate.morningstar.com/ib/documents/MethodologyDocuments/OptimalWithdrawlStrategyRetirementIncomePortfolios.pdf">Optimal Withdrawal Strategy for Retirement Income Portfolios</a> because it assumes a single sequence of returns. When returns vary depending on the asset allocation decisions made the formula for computing the WER breaks down.
</p>

<p>
Use of a lifetime CE raises the question of what is the appropriate utility function to use. We use a power utility function with a coefficient of relative risk aversion of &eta;. Which then begs the question of what is an appropriate value for &eta;. Unlike Blanchett, et al. who use a &eta; of 5, we believe a reasonable value for &eta; is 3. An individual is neutral to consuming one year at 50% consumption in exchange for 2<sup>&eta;-1</sup> years at 200% consumption. And thus by extension, neutral to consuming one year at 25% consumption in exchange for 4<sup>&eta;-1</sup> years at 400% consumption. Plugging in an &eta; of 3 gives one year at 50% in exchange for 4 years at 200%, and one year at 25% in exchange for 16 years at 400%.  An &eta; of 3 represents our baseline case; 2 represents risk tolerant; and 4 risk averse.
</p>

<p>
We compute the lifetime CE using returns that are independent over time. This means SDP should produce the best possible results. In reality there are phenomena known as volatility predictability, momentum, and reversion to the mean that means in the real world it might be possible to do better than SDP. We will return to this issue later.
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>
The results of the different asset allocation strategies paired with the different withdrawal strategies for the affluent - constrained scenario are shown in the table below.
</p>

<table>
<tr> <td rowspan=2 colspan=2> lifetime CE <br /> best location </td> <td colspan=6> withdrawal strategy </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> amount <br /> 4.0% </td> <td> amount <br /> best </td> <td> percentage <br /> best </td> <td> 1/life </td> <td> hybrid <br /> 4.0% </td> <td> SDP </td> </tr>
<tr> <td rowspan=5> asset allocation strategy </td> <td> fixed </td> <td> $38,956 <br /> 40/60 </td> <td> $40,101 <br /> 40/60 4.8% </td> <td> $42,713 <br /> 90/10 6.9% </td> <td> $45,284 <br /> 80/20 </td> <td> $43,836 <br /> 70/30 </td> <td> $45,597 <br /> 80/20 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> age in bonds </td> <td> $38,813 <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $39,643 <br /> 4.6% </td> <td> $39,593 <br /> 6.7% </td> <td> $42,534 <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $41,681 <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $42,716 <br /> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> age minus 10 in bonds </td> <td> $38,870 <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $39,919 <br /> 4.7% </td> <td> $40,469 <br /> 6.7% </td> <td> $43,403 <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $42,516 <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $43,614 <br /> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> target date </td> <td> $38,883 <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $39,914 <br /> 4.7% </td> <td> $40,492 <br /> 6.7% </td> <td> $43,433 <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $42,534 <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $43,635 <br /> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> SDP </td> <td> $39,153 <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $40,757 <br /> 5.0% </td> <td> $42,856 <br /> 6.9% </td> <td> $45,493 <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $44,043 <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $45,743 <br /> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
Note that the SDP results are the maximum values for each row and column. This is as we would expect, since the SDP algorithm produces the optimal value.
</p>

<p>
Of the asset allocation strategies age in bonds, age minus 10 in bonds, and target date all perform poorly. Fixed performs almost as well as SDP. Looking at the asset allocations for fixed that perform best suggests that for this scenario the optimal asset allocation is typically stock heavy, and age in bonds, age minus 10 in bonds, and target date have too many bonds to compete. The exceptions being for the two amount strategies, which are balanced, and here age in bonds, age minus 10 in bonds,, and target date perform quite a bit better. This might explain the discrepancy between the retirement asset allocation recommendations of practitioners, who tend to favor bonds, and theorists, who tend to recommend stocks. The practitioner studies tend to assume a fixed withdrawal amount, while the theorists allow the withdrawal amount to vary, so providing a relief valve to stock volatility; a relief valve that is instead provided by bonds in practitioner studies.
</p>

<p>
Of all the withdrawal strategies, the two fixed amount strategies perform worst. This is understandable, they do not adjust their behavior to the performance of the portfolio post retirement. Hybrid 4.0% performs quite well, but the star is 1/life, which comes close to SDP.
</p>

<p>
Also note variable withdrawals work well. The 1/life and SDP strategies perform significantly better than the best fixed withdrawal amount strategy. For the fixed and SDP asset allocation strategies the advantage of variable withdrawals over the best fixed amount is a little over 10% of the lifetime CE.
</p>

<p>
In this scenario fixed / 1/life achieves 99% of the lifetime CE of SDP/SDP, and thus, provided the fixed asset allocation can be determined, is a serious contender to use in advising clients. Computing the best fixed asset allocation to the nearest 1% instead of the nearest 10% does not improve upon this result.
</p>

<h2>Scenarios evaluation</h2>

<p>
Since the fixed / 1/life strategy performed so well, we will evaluate it for the other scenarios here. We will also look at the fixed / amount best strategy for each scenario so we can compare asset allocations.
</p>

<table>
<tr> <td>                             </td> <td> fixed / amount best       </td> <td> fixed / 1/life       </td> <td> SDP/SDP </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> mass market - underfunded   </td> <td> $24,894 <br /> 70/30 6.6% </td> <td> $26,250 <br /> 100/0 </td> <td> $26,301 <br /> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> affluent - constrained      </td> <td> $40,101 <br /> 40/60 4.8% </td> <td> $45,284 <br /> 80/20 </td> <td> $45,743 <br /> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> high net worth - overfunded </td> <td> $74,459 <br /> 40/60 4.7% </td> <td> $84,736 <br /> 80/20 </td> <td> $85,732 <br /> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
In each case fixed / 1/life performs very close to the optimum, and in each case the portfolio is very stock heavy.
</p>

<p>
Looking at fixed / amount best, in two of the three scenarios the portfolio is balanced. A fixed withdrawal portfolio is balanced, while variable withdrawals appear to substitute for bonds in some sense, allowing the portfolio to be more volatile in exchange for increased potential rewards. In the third case, mass market - underfunded case, tilting more towards stocks might simply represent the best of the losing bets.
</p>

<h2>Sensitivity analysis</h2>

<p>
Fixed / 1/life is 80/20 stocks/bonds for the affluent - constrained scenario. This might seem high, until it is realized the Social Security acts as a bond substitute, providing a stable source of income. If Social Security is reduced, then the bond portion rises. For this reason great care must be taken in interpreting the results of studies that do not include non-portfolio income sources such as Social Security, defined benefit pensions, and annuities.
</p>

<table>
<tr> <td> Social Security </td> <td> fixed / 1/life       </td> <td> SDP/SDP </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>           20000 <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $45,284 <br /> 80/20 </td> <td> $45,743 <br /> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>           10000 <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $33,226 <br /> 70/30 </td> <td> $33,301 <br /> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>            1000 <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $15,914 <br /> 60/40 </td> <td> $15,948 <br /> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
Increasing the degree of risk aversion will also increase bonds:
</p>

<table>
<tr> <td> &eta; </td> <td> fixed / 1/life       </td> <td>  SDP/SDP </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>     3 <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $45,284 <br /> 80/20 </td> <td> $45,743 <br /> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>     4 <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $43,291 <br /> 70/30 </td> <td> $44,033 <br /> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>    10 <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $34,092 <br /> 60/40 </td> <td> $38,942 <br /> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
Reducing the return on equities from 5.0% geometric mean will as expected boost bonds:
</p>

<table>
<tr> <td> stocks geomean </td> <td> fixed / 1/life       </td> <td> SDP/SDP </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>           5.0% <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $45,284 <br /> 80/20 </td> <td> $45,743 <br /> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>           4.0% <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $43,389 <br /> 70/30 </td> <td> $43,727 <br /> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>           3.0% <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $41,850 <br /> 50/50 </td> <td> $42,105 <br /> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
Simultaneously altering the stock and bond returns has a smaller effect:
</p>

<table>
<tr> <td> stock geomean return </td> <td> bond geomean return </td> <td> fixed / 1/life       </td> <td>  SDP/SDP </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> 5.0% <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> 2.1% <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $45,284 <br /> 80/20 </td> <td> $45,743 <br /> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> 6.0% <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> 3.1% <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $47,975 <br /> 80/20 </td> <td> $48,570 <br /> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> 7.0% <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> 4.1% <br /> &nbsp; </td> <td> $50,881 <br /> 70/30 </td> <td> $51,670 <br /> &nbsp; </td> </tr>
</table>

<h2>Consumption volatility</h2>

<p>
It is reasonable to wonder how much consumption might vary for the variable withdrawal strategies. Sample consumption paths for SDP/SDP and the affluent - constrained scenario are shown below. It is likely that death will occur before the later part of the paths is reached so more emphasis should be placed on performance at earlier ages.
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/static/docs/variable_withdrawal_showdown-sdp-sdp-paths-consume.png"/>
</div>

<p>
Social Security imposes a $20,000 consumption floor. As might be expected the further from the floor you are the more volatile things are, and the closer to the floor the less volatile.
</p>

<p>
The best fixed / 1/life strategy is shown below. Care was taken to use the same asset class return sequences as previously. This graph tells a similar story to SDP/SDP, except that it is more pronounced on the high side and for ages 95-100 where a distinct depletion trend is more readily apparent. Comparing this to the optimum paths computed using SDP suggests 1/age might be a little bit too aggressive.
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/static/docs/variable_withdrawal_showdown-fixed-0.8-life-paths-consume.png"/>
</div>

<p>
These paths should be compared with the best fixed/amount strategy, which offers absolute consumption stability until it suddenly fails as shown below. Variable withdrawals are more volatile, but they let you down more gently.
</p>

<h2>Optimal asset allocation in Merton's portfolio problem</h2>

<p>This good performance of a fixed asset allocation is consistent with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merton%27s_portfolio_problem">Merton's portfolio problem</a>, which predicts a fixed asset allocation for a risky and a risk free asset and a fixed time period. According to Samuelson and Merton the proportion of the risky asset should be equal to the difference in the arithmetic returns of the two asset classes divided by the standard deviation of the risky assets returns times the coefficient of relative risk aversion. We can consider Social Security as roughly equivalent to bonds worth the annual Social Security payment x remaining life expectancy (24.1 years). We can do this because bond returns are close to zero:
</p>

<p>
recommended investment portfolio stock fraction = (portfolio size + social security x remaining life expectancy) x asset class arithmetic returns difference / (portfolio size x stocks standard deviation x &eta;)
</p>

<p>
This allows us to compute the following table (in which reported returns are after management expenses):
</p>

<table>
<tr> <td> portfolio size </td> <td> Social Security </td> <td> stocks geometric / arithmetic mean </td> <td> bonds geometric / arithmetic mean </td> <td> stocks standard deviation </td> <td> &eta; </td> <td> recommended investment portfolio stock fraction (treating bonds as risk free) </td> <td> observed fixed best asset allocation </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>   $500,000 </td> <td> $20,000 </td> <td> 4.90% / 6.77% </td> <td> 2.00% / 2.34% </td> <td> 19.41% </td> <td>  3 </td> <td>  77% </td> <td> 80/20 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>   $100,000 </td> <td> $20,000 </td> <td> 4.90% / 6.77% </td> <td> 2.00% / 2.34% </td> <td> 19.41% </td> <td>  3 </td> <td> 228% </td> <td> 100/0 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> $1,000,000 </td> <td> $35,000 </td> <td> 4.90% / 6.77% </td> <td> 2.00% / 2.34% </td> <td> 19.41% </td> <td>  3 </td> <td>  72% </td> <td> 80/20 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>   $500,000 </td> <td> $10,000 </td> <td> 4.90% / 6.77% </td> <td> 2.00% / 2.34% </td> <td> 19.41% </td> <td>  3 </td> <td>  58% </td> <td> 70/30 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>   $500,000 </td> <td>  $1,000 </td> <td> 4.90% / 6.77% </td> <td> 2.00% / 2.34% </td> <td> 19.41% </td> <td>  3 </td> <td>  41% </td> <td> 60/40 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>   $500,000 </td> <td> $20,000 </td> <td> 4.90% / 6.77% </td> <td> 2.00% / 2.34% </td> <td> 19.41% </td> <td>  4 </td> <td>  58% </td> <td> 70/30 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>   $500,000 </td> <td> $20,000 </td> <td> 4.90% / 6.77% </td> <td> 2.00% / 2.34% </td> <td> 19.41% </td> <td> 10 </td> <td>  23% </td> <td> 60/40 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>   $500,000 </td> <td> $20,000 </td> <td> 3.90% / 5.75% </td> <td> 2.00% / 2.34% </td> <td> 19.22% </td> <td>  3 </td> <td>  60% </td> <td> 70/30 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>   $500,000 </td> <td> $20,000 </td> <td> 2.90% / 4.73% </td> <td> 2.00% / 2.34% </td> <td> 19.04% </td> <td>  3 </td> <td>  43% </td> <td> 50/50 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>   $500,000 </td> <td> $20,000 </td> <td> 5.89% / 7.78% </td> <td> 3.00% / 3.35% </td> <td> 19.59% </td> <td>  3 </td> <td>  76% </td> <td> 80/20 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>   $500,000 </td> <td> $20,000 </td> <td> 6.89% / 8.80% </td> <td> 4.00% / 4.35% </td> <td> 19.78% </td> <td>  3 </td> <td>  74% </td> <td> 70/30 </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
Since bonds are not actually risk free we would expect a higher proportion of stocks than what we calculate, and this is what we find. Given this, many of the results roughly agree, but there are discrepancies, particularly for small Social Security payouts or large values of &eta;. This suggests the approximate agreement breaks down when steeper portions of the utility function come into play.
</p>

<h2>Optimal withdrawal on Milevsky and Huang's Planet Vulcan</h2>

<p>
The good performance of the 1/life withdrawal strategy is consistent with Milevsky and Huang's <a href="http://www.ifid.ca/pdf_workingpapers/Spending_Retirement_Vulcan_14MAR2010.pdf">Spending Retirement on Planet Vulcan: The Impact of Longevity Risk Aversion on Optimal Withdrawal Rates</a> who consider the utility maximizing consumption sequence for a single asset with a fixed rate of return and a stochastic life span. For a rate of return of 0%, an &eta; of 1, no time discounting of future consumption, and either a portfolio depletion time equal to the remaining life expectancy or no Social Security, they find an optimal portfolio withdrawal equal to portfolio size / remaining life expectancy. For an &eta; other than 1, the optimal withdrawal rate is portfolio size / modified life expectancy. For a rate of return other than 0%, or a different portfolio depletion time and Social Security, the formula is more complex. These statements are derived from their formula:
</p>

<p>
C<sub>0</sub><sup>*</sup> = ((W + &pi;<sub>0</sub>/r).e<sup>r&tau;</sup> - &pi;<sub>0</sub>/r) / (a<sub>x</sub><sup>&tau;</sup>(r-k,m<sup>*</sup>,b).e<sup>r&tau;</sup>)
</p>

<p>
The high &eta; asset allocations we considered when we looked at Merton's portfolio problem that we were unable to explain are those we would expect to be most likely to require the more complex consumption formulas on Planet Vulcan. Perhaps if we used those consumption formulas the best fixed asset allocations would be more in line with what we had expected.
</p>

<h2>Non-independent returns</h2>

<p>
We mentioned previously that for non-independent returns SDP need not produce the best asset allocation / withdrawal strategy. If either momentum or reversion to the mean are present, it seems reasonable to assume a slight bias of the computed strategy towards/away from stocks might improve the results. The results are shown below for bootstrap return sequences with a block size of 20 years and wrapping:
</p>

<table>
<tr> <td> stock bias </td> <td> SDP/SDP </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>      -1% </td> <td> $46,598 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>       0% </td> <td> $46,616 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>      +1% </td> <td> $46,624 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>      +2% </td> <td> $46,630 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>      +3% </td> <td> $46,630 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>      +4% </td> <td> $46,627 </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
As can be seen both the size of the optimal bias, and its effects are negligible. This suggests, but by no means proves, that the results produced using SDP are very close to optimal for real world, non-independent returns. This does nothing to help though with the requirement that future returns be from a known distribution.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
A fixed retirement asset allocation tilted heavily towards stocks, and a withdrawal strategy of portfolio size / remaining life expectancy offers close to optimum performance over a range of likely scenarios. An 80/20 asset allocation is suggested. A lower allocation to stocks makes sense if the expected risk premium of stocks over bonds is less than 3% geometric mean, Social Security and other defined benefits make up less than half the total income (income from investments should estimated by dividing portfolio size by remaining life expectancy), or you are highly risk averse.
</p>

<p>
This contrasts sharply with a fixed amount withdrawal strategy, for which a withdrawal rate of roughly 4-5% of the initial portfolio size, and a balanced portfolio seem best. Although it sound similar, this result is not directly comparable to that of Bengen (<a href="http://www.retailinvestor.org/pdf/Bengen1.pdf">Determining withdrawal rates using historical data</a>). In our study we project lower stock returns than the historical record, but this is offset by having Social Security as a non-depletable bond like resource. Additionally Bengen sought absolute safety over a fixed number of years based on the historical record, while we seek the best outcome for a stochastic life span based on an adjusted historical record.
</p>

<p>
Faced with poor prospects it seems likely that most retirees will cut back on consumption; or increase consumption in response to good times. Thus, even ignoring utility maximization arguments, the choice between the two approaches should be clear.
</p>

<h2>Scenario</h2>

<p>
A retired male/female couple, both age 65. Longevity is as specified by the U.S. Social Security Cohort Life Tables for a person of the given initial age in 2013. No value is placed on any inheritance that is left. No additions to the portfolio are permitted, and withdrawals are made using the current asset allocation. Taxes were ignored. No transaction costs were assumed for rebalancing, sales, or purchases. All amounts are adjusted for inflation. No time discounting of the future is performed.
</p>

<p>
Asset allocation strategies: Rebalancing is performed annually. Returns data for 1927-2012 were used by SDP to generate the strategies. A zero consumption level of $0 was used, with 0% phase out with increasing income.
</p>

<p>
Withdrawal strategies: Withdrawal are performed annually at the start of the year.
</p>

<p>
Asset classes and returns: U.S. stocks and 10 year Treasuries as supplied by Shiller (Irrational Exuberance, 2005 updated) but adjusted so the real return on stocks is 5.0% and bonds 2.1% before expenses. Management expenses are 0.1%.
