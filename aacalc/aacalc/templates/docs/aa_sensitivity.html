<h1>How Much Does Asset Allocation Matter?</h1>

<p>
Asset allocation matters, but achieving the optimal asset allocation
probably matters less than you might think. If you are using variable
withdrawals then provided you adopt and stick with a high stock
allocation you should do reasonably well.
</p>

<h2>Scenario</h2>

<p>
Consider a 65 year old male with a stochastic life span, no bequest
motive, and receiving $15k/year in Social Security. Their stated floor
consumption level is $30k/year, and they would like to consume an
additional $10k beyond that.  Above this they derive little utility
from additional consumption.  We model this with a coefficient of
relative risk aversion of 4 up to $30k, dropping down to 1 above
$40k. Floor consumption is considered 10 times more important than
surplus consumption.
</p>

<p>
Since we are only concerned with math not psychology here, we consider
the individual to have an unlimited risk tolerance, and do not impose
a cap on the maximum stock holdings. However, we do not allow
leverage.
</p>

<p>
For stocks we use the annual U.S. large cap returns and for bonds the
10 year Treasury returns for 1927-2014. The equity risk premium is
4.6% geometric mean.  This is comparable to equity risk premiums
predicted in the future.  The returns for stocks are expected to be
lower in the future but so are bonds, leaving the equity risk premium
relatively unchanged.  We are interested in the equity risk premium
because it is what determines how much to allocate to stocks and how
much to allocate to bonds according to the solution to Merton's
portfolio problem.
</p>

<p>
Suppose the individual had perfect knowledge of the distribution of
annual returns, but not their sequencing. Then there exists an optimal
asset allocation and consumption strategy as a function of age and
portfolio size. Moreover, provided the returns are independent over
time, it is possible to compute this strategy using stochastic dynamic
programming.
</p>

<p>
The future is discounted at a rate of 1.5% per year. Management
expenses are assumed to be 0.1% per year. The individual wishes to maximize expected lifetime
utility.
</p>

<h2>Life is not a glide path</h2>

<p>
The optimal allocation to stocks as a function of age and portfolio
size computed using stochastic dynamic programming is shown below. This graph is a heat map. The optimal allocation
is determined by first determining the color of the graph for a
specified age and portfolio size, and then determining the asset
allocation corresponding to that color using the color scale on the
right.
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/static/docs/aa_sensitivity-stocks.png" alt="stocks heatmap"/>
</div>

<p>
The bottom portion of the graph shows a 100% allocation to
stocks. This is because the vast majority of the income is in the form
of Social Security, which acts as a surrogate bond holding, and causes
what otherwise would be a balanced allocation to tilt heavily towards
stocks.
<p>

<p>
The top portion of the graph is again 100% stocks. This time because
the low coefficient of relative risk aversion that prevails when you
are wealthy allows more risk to be taken. In fact, ignoring Social
Security, the allocation to stocks is inversely proportional to
coefficient of relative risk aversion. This means the allocation to
stocks should be 4 times what it is when consumption is below $30k.
</p>

<p>
In the middle is a more balanced asset allocation region.
</p>

<p>
The path the optimal asset allocation takes is not a smooth glide down
one of these regions. This is because portfolio size is volatile. The
figure below shows 10 sample portfolio paths for a starting portfolio
size of $500k.
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/static/docs/aa_sensitivity-paths-p.png" alt="portfolio paths"/>
</div>

<p>
This portfolio size volatility creates significant volatility in the
optimal asset allocation path. 10 sample asset allocation paths are
shown below.

<h2>How much asset allocation matters</h2>

<p>
Following the optimal asset allocation is clearly a challenging task.
What if we were off from the optimal stock allocation by a constant
+20% every year, and bonds by -20%, while still consuming the
recommended optimal consumption amount.  How much would our average
lifetime consumption utility be reduced as a result? To make the
numbers involved tangible we make use of the concept of certainty
equivalence, which is the constant consumption level having the same
expected utility as a particular consumption sequence. From this we
subtract Social Security to get the dollar amount of consumption that
results from the portfolio investments. Then we compare the investment
derived consumption to the investment derived consumption for the
optimal asset allocation.
</p>

<p>
Computing the investment derived consumption for a range of initial
portfolio sizes and excess stock allocations results in the following
figure. Note that the lines for the constrained and affluent initial
portfolio sizes to the right of the 0% excess stock allocation do not
show because they are coincident with the top frame of the graph.
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/static/docs/aa_sensitivity-65.png" alt="aa sensitivity"/>
</div>

<p>
What this graph shows is the relatively low sensitivity of portfolio
derived consumption to asset allocation. For the retiree a -20%
mis-allocation to stocks, i.e. being 20% too bond heavy, will only
result in a 4-5% reduction in investment derived consumption.
</p>

<p>
A +20% over allocation to stocks results in a 3% reduction for the
affluent retiree, and 0% for the constrained and very high net worth
retirees.
</p>

<p>
These results can be understood by looking at the sample asset
allocation paths shown previously. The sample paths show stock
allocations in the range 60-100%. Adding +20% to this range we will
sometimes hit the 100% stocks cap, thus it is reasonable to expect
reducing stocks to have a bigger impact than increasing stocks. The
sample paths were for the affluent retiree. Referring to the stock
asset allocation heat map we would expect the constrained and very
high net worth retirees to have asset allocations much closer to 100%
stocks. For this reason increasing the stock asset allocation barely
effects performance.
</p>

<h2>What is the effect of the reduced utility of upside consumption?</h2>

<p>
We have been using a "floor and upside" utility function. What effect
might this have? The figure below shows the asset allocation
sensitivity using a constant relative risk aversion utility function
with a coefficient of relative risk aversion of 4 everywhere.
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/static/docs/aa_sensitivity-crra4-65.png" alt="aa sensitivity crra 4"/>
</div>

<p>
As might be expected the right hand side now shows the curve for the
very high net worth individual. Apart from this though there aren't
any major changes. A +/-20% change in asset allocation from optimal
results in a 0-4% change in lifetime investment derived consumption.
</p>

<h2>Impact over a lifetime</h2>

<p>
So far we have only considered a retired individual. Getting things
wrong over a lifetime we might expect to have a bigger effect.
</p>

<p>
We compute the optimal strategy for an individual age 25, no initial
savings, and real investment savings contribution roughly doubling
every decade until retirement. The approach we take isn't perfect. In
particular retirement savings would probably best be described using a
stochastic model rather than a fixed schedule. We chose the simple
approach for expedience. But note a stochastic model would give future
retirement savings a risky status potentially offsetting some of the
need for high stock allocations. The impact of this expediency isn't
known.
</p>

<p>
The figure below shows that a 20% over allocation to bonds results in
a 11-24% impact on portfolio derived consumption. Meanwhile a 20% over
allocation to stocks results in only a 0-4% reduction in portfolio
derived consumption.
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/static/docs/aa_sensitivity-25.png" alt="aa sensitivity age 25"/>
</div>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
The optimal asset allocation is difficult to achieve. It varies
considerably from one year to the next depending on both age and
portfolio size.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately it isn't necessary to obtain the optimal asset allocation.
Since optimal asset allocations are stock heavy, and the penalty for
too many bonds is significantly larger than the penalty for too many
stocks, this argues strongly for very high stock allocations
throughout the life cycle.
</p>

<p>
Constrained portfolios should be 100% stocks on account of the
surrogate bond like nature of Social Security. Very high net worth
portfolios should also be 100% stocks this time on account of their
experiencing a low coefficient of relative risk aversion. It is only
affluent portfolios that might warrant a lower stock allocation. For
the coefficient of relative risk aversion and equity risk premium
considered here, stock allocations of 60-100% occur, and so based on
the above considerations utilizing a fixed lifetime stock allocation
of 90 or even 100% might be reasonable.
</p>

<p>
These arguments carry through only so far as the optimal amount is
being withdrawn from the portfolio. This is difficult to calculate but
earlier work suggests portfolio size divided by remaining life
expectancy and a technique known as variable percentage withdrawal
seem to provide a reasonable proxies for the amount to withdraw.
